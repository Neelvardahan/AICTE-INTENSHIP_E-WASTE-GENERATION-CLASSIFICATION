♻️ E-Waste Generation Classification using EfficientNetV2B0 (AICTE Internship Project)

Overview
This project aims to classify various types of electronic waste (e-waste) using deep learning. It was developed as part of the AICTE Virtual Internship Program to raise awareness about sustainable e-waste disposal using AI-driven image classification.

Problem Statement
Manual sorting of electronic waste is inefficient, labor-intensive, and often inaccurate. Automating this process using AI can significantly improve recycling processes, reduce environmental damage, and support the circular economy.

Objective
To build a deep learning model that accurately classifies images of e-waste (e.g. mobile phones, batteries, washing machines, etc.) using transfer learning with EfficientNetV2B0.
